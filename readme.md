**File System Implementation README**

---


**Overview:**
This project implements a simple file system in C. It provides functionalities for formatting the file system, adding/removing files, listing files/directories, and extracting files from the file system.

**Testing:**
- The file system functionality has been tested with various scenarios, including:
  - Creating and formatting a new file system.
  - Adding and removing files.
  - Listing files and directories.
  - Extracting files from the file system.
- Test cases cover both normal and edge cases to ensure robustness.

**Configuration:**
- The file system parameters such as block size, segment size, and number of inodes per segment can be configured in the `fs.h` header file.
- Adjustments to these parameters may affect the performance and behavior of the file system.

**Compiling:**
- The project can be compiled using the provided Makefile.
- Simply run `make` command in the terminal to build the executable.
- The compiled binary will be named `main` and can be executed with appropriate command line arguments.

**Usage:**
- The main executable `main` takes command line arguments to perform various file system operations.
- Usage: `./main [-l] [-a path] [-e path] [-r path] -f name`
  - `-l`: List files and directories in the file system.
  - `-a path`: Add a file to the file system.
  - `-e path`: Extract a file from the file system.
  - `-r path`: Remove a file from the file system.
  - `-f name`: Specify the file system name.

**Known Issues:**
